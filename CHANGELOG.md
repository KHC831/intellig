## [Unreleased]

Changes between releases land here. At release time, this section is
renamed to the new version (e.g. `## [0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`) and a
fresh empty `[Unreleased]` block is added on top.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- The Changed Files panel now renders as a collapsible tree.
- The Git tool window shows a clear "no repository" message when no Git repo is open.

### Fixed

- Merge commits now show their changed files in the details panel instead of "No changed files".
- Removed a phantom lane stub that drew above the topmost commit row in the graph.
- Tightened the column spacing in the commit history pane.
- Bug fixes for failed merge / rebase / cherry-pick / revert operations.

### Changed

- Every IntelliG command invocation and handler outcome is now logged to `Output → IntelliG` for easier troubleshooting.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Deleting an unmerged branch now prompts for force-delete instead of surfacing git's raw CLI hint.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Bug reports and security disclosures now route through the public `intellig-issues` repo instead of a direct email address.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

Initial Marketplace release as a preview.

### Added

- IntelliJ IDEA-style Git workflows for VS Code: changelists, commit dialog, branch popup, interactive rebase, shelf, three-way merge view, blame annotations, and IntelliJ-style context menus.
- Multi-repo support including nested-repo discovery and mid-session `git init` auto-detection.
- `Output → IntelliG` diagnostic channel for init, watcher, and per-file operation errors.
- Coexistence with VS Code's built-in Git extension.

### Deprecated

- `intellig.useIntelliJKeymap` is superseded by `intellig.keymapPreset` and migrates automatically on first activation.
